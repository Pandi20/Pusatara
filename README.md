# Batik and Songket Motif Classification Machine Learning Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources to build a machine learning model for classifying Batik and Songket motifs. The model is trained to distinguish between these two traditional textile patterns, commonly found in Southeast Asian cultures. This README.md file provides detailed instructions on how others can replicate the steps to create and deploy the classification model.

## 1. Dataset

The dataset used for training the model should consist of labeled images of Batik and Songket motifs. Ensure that you have a balanced dataset with sufficient examples of each class. You can organize the dataset into separate folders for each class.

```
dataset/
|-- batik/
|   |-- batik_image1.jpg
|   |-- batik_image2.jpg
|   |-- ...
|-- songket/
|   |-- songket_image1.jpg
|   |-- songket_image2.jpg
|   |-- ...
```

## 2. Preprocessing

Before training the model, it's crucial to preprocess the images. The preprocessing steps may include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. The `model.ipynb` notebook in the repository provides an example of how to perform these tasks using a popular image processing library.

## 3. Model Training

Use the `model.ipynb` notebook to train the machine learning model. This notebook contains code for loading the preprocessed data and training a deep learning model using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Tune hyperparameters and experiment with different architectures to achieve the best performance.

## 4. Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using the `model.ipynb` notebook. This notebook includes code for loading the trained model and assessing its accuracy on a separate test set.

## 5. Deployment

To deploy the model for real-world use, you can use frameworks like Flask for creating a web service or convert the model to another format like tensorflow js. The `api` branch contains examples for tensorflow js deployment scenarios.

## 6. Usage

Provide clear instructions on how to use the trained model for predictions. If you've created a web service, include API documentation. If the model is intended for local use, demonstrate how to load the model and make predictions using the `usage.ipynb` notebook.

## 7. Contributing

Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome.
