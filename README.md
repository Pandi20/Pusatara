# Pusatara
## Introduction
This is a capstone project for our [Bangkit Academy](https://g.co/bangkit)'s final assignment. Our project is dedicated to addressing the significant issue of inadequate awareness and appreciation of traditional Indonesian fabrics like [Batik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batik) and [Songket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songket). 

### Why?
These fabrics are not merely textiles; they embody a rich cultural heritage, featuring intricate craftsmanship, diverse motifs, and age-old traditions. Regrettably, their cultural significance often remains concealed due to a lack of proper education and information dissemination to younger generations. Our team is determined to develop a comprehensive solution to educate, engage, and connect enthusiasts and artisans.
